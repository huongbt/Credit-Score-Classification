# Credit-Score-Classification
A credit score tells lenders about your creditworthiness. Companies use credit scores to make decisions on whether to offer you a mortgage, credit card, auto loan, and other credit products. With fast incresing in using Machine Learning and Deep Learning for most of our aspect of lives, banks and credit card companies are not out of these trends. They use Machine learning algorithms to classify their customers's credit card score into different levels based on their customers's historical data.
In this project, I build a classifier to classify credit score into three different labels (Good, Standard, Poor) using Machine Learning models and Python. Data used in this project is based on the credit score classification submitted by Rohan Paris on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/parisrohan
